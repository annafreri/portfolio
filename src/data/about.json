This environment provided me with the freedom to explore different disciplines and crafts, leading me to realize that versatility is what I find truly fulfilling and ultimately rewarding. Above all, I consider myself a maker and problem solver. While tasks and procedures may vary, they all serve the same purpose: telling engaging stories and creating useful and simply great products that users can relate to and be excited about. I firmly believe that understanding the problem and possessing the problem-solving skills required to arrive at a solution are the key elements in designing exceptional experiences and products, regardless of the medium."
