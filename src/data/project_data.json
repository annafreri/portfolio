Interactive elements, like synchronized lights triggered by proximity sensors, create a sense of connection. As users approach their respective boxes, the lights gradually brighten, a visual cue that someone is present on the other side. A touch sensor within each box allows users to initiate a synchronized action â€“ a gentle pink glow bathes both boxes simultaneously, a powerful symbol of connection across the divide. Limited printer resources necessitated meticulous testing during the development phase, but the result is a testament to the power of shared experience in fostering empathy and understanding, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable barriers."

The images undergo a continual transformation as an algorithm dynamically alters the color of each pixel. This constantly evolving display challenges recognition and perception of the subject."
